= Parallel programming on Lisa =
Roughly, parallel computing occurs when a problem is split in different tasks that are executed in 
parallel. A program needs to be designed to run in parallel. 
Any parallel program makes use of some sort of middle ware that enables communication between 
its parallel processes. One of these is  MPI (Message Passing Interface).  On the 64-bit  nodes Lisa 
uses a an MPI implementation called Open MPI. Open MPI materializes in a set of libraries, 
containing methods for exchanging information between parallel processes in a program. 
It is possible to run Octave parallel code on the 64-bit architecture nodes on the  Lisa cluster.1  
Although Lisa has a Matlab module installed, only serial jobs can be run, i.e jobs that are executed 
on a single node. Of course, one can run several serial jobs in parallel, but a single Matlab program 
(job) cannot be split in several processes that  run in parallel. 
If you would like to execute parallel programs on Lisa, for the time being you need to run your 
coding as Octave. In general, Matlab code is compatible with Octave, but there are a few syntax 
differences.  Some of them are  described in this wiki book:

= Short Introduction to Parallel SCEM =
SCEM-UA  is a general purpose global parameter optimization algorithm that provides an estimate 
of the most likely parameter set and its underlying posterior probability distribution. 
In general, application of global optimization methods to high-dimensional parameter estimation 
problems requires the solution of a large number of deterministic model runs. SCEM-UA's 
architecture in itself is embarrassingly parallel, i.e it can be decomposed into processes that are 
executed in parallel. More exactly, independent model simulations can run on different nodes of a 
distributed system. This takes place in two phases using the master-slave paradigm. In the first 
phase, the master samples (s) parameter combinations randomly from the prior distribution and 
distributes the evaluation of the fitness function for the individuals in the population over the slave 
processors. The slaves compute the posterior probabilities and send the results back to the master. In 
the second phase, the master sorts the points in decreasing order of the posterior probability 
distribution, initializes the starting points of the (k) sequences and builds the corresponding 
complexes. Then it generates and distributes the new candidate points to the slaves. Each slave 
evolves a different sequence and complex and sends the results to the master. The master unpacks 
1As of March 18th 2009, new 64-bit architecture nodes were added to the Lisa cluster. In the end all 
nodes will run in AMD64 mode.  On these nodes  OpenMPI is the standard message passing 
interface. More details on this topic here:

To log in to the AMD-64 environment, you need to log in using the host name

the complexes back into the set and sorts the points in decreasing order of the posterior probability 
distribution, checks the convergence and, if necessary, re-iterates. 
Parallel SCEM-UA is the adaptation of the SCEM-UA algorithm implemented in GNU Octave for 
multiprocessor distributed systems using  the MPI standard (Open MPI) (enabled in Octave by 
MPITB). 
If you would like to apply the SCEM algorithm to optimize the parameters of your model, you can 
simply do so by providing your model, some initialization parameters, the measurement data and 
instructing SCEM where to find them. A detailed description on how to proceed,is provided in the 
rest o this document.

= Create an account on the Lisa cluster =

If you do not have  an account on the Lisa cluster, send an e-mail to SARA (hic@sara.nl) with the 
following information: 

* Your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address 
* The faculty and/or subfaculty 
* The project leader (including email address) 
* An estimation of cpu-hours needed (for instance  10 node-hours) 
* A short description of your project (10 lines or less) 

= Log in to your Lisa account =

Lisa cluster runs on Linux OS. To connect to your Lisa account from your machine you will need a 
SSH client. On Windows, you can use a program called Putty. You can download the latest version 
of Putty from http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe. 
1. Run putty.exe 
2. Fill in the host name with lisa64.sara.nl 
3. Make sure SSH is enabled 
4. Click “Open”
5. Fill in your username and password when prompted. 
After the first login, don't forget to change your password, using the passwd command.
